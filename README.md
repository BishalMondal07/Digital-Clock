# Digital Clock
The "Digital Clock" is a simple Tkinter application that displays the current time and date in a digital format. It provides a window with labels for the clock and date, which are updated in real-time.

# Prerequisites
To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, make sure that the Tkinter library is available. Tkinter is usually included with Python installations, so no additional installation should be required.

# Getting Started
1. Open a text editor and create a new Python file.

2. Copy the provided code into the file.

3. Save the file with a ".py" extension, for example, digital_clock.py.

# Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.

3. Run the Python file using the following command:
```bash
  python digital_clock.py
```
4. The application window should appear with the current time and date displayed.

# How to Use
The application automatically updates the clock and date labels every second. There are no user interactions required. Simply run the application, and it will display the current time and date.

# Customization
● If you want to customize the application, you can modify the code as per your requirements. Here are a few possible modifications:

● Change the window title: Modify the window.title("Digital Clock") line and replace "Digital Clock" with your desired title.

● Adjust the font and appearance: Modify the font parameter in the Label constructor calls to change the font family, size, and style of the clock and date labels. You can also modify the background color (bg) and foreground color (fg) to change the colors of the labels.

● Modify the time and date format: If you want to change the format of the time and date displayed, update the strftime() format strings in the update_clock() function. Refer to the Python strftime() documentation for the available format codes.

# Limitations
● The application relies on the system's clock to determine the current time and date. If the system clock is not accurate or synchronized, the displayed time and date may be incorrect.

● The application updates the clock and date labels every second. This can consume system resources, especially if the application is running for an extended period. Consider adjusting the update interval (after() delay) if needed.

# Conclusion
The "Digital Clock" is a simple Python application that displays the current time and date in a digital format. It can be used as a standalone clock or as a component in a larger application. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or extend its functionality further.
